# Suggested Improvements
- Add a toggle to view boxes by seasons. When selected, update the legend to reflect seasonal stages.

- Include a button to switch the timeline from 90 to 75 years. This allows for a more personalized lifespan view.

- Apply translucent coloring to boxes instead of leaving them blank. Use the designated color with reduced opacity to visually indicate the remaining time in each life stage.

- Redesign the website for improved aesthetics and usability. Aim for a cleaner, more engaging user experience.
